Rethinking spotify web api junk:

Need to reconfigure the spotify web api junk via the actual spotify web api rather than the wrapper.

I need to write functions for getUserProfile, getArtistProfile, getSongs (or whatever else entails playing songs)

Need to also make a limiter for how long the song plays

Need to make the winning screen show the album art
